Quick post about some common Linux commands...that I've seen many times:


1. tar - used to unzip compressed (.gz) files:
```javascript
$ tar -xzvf file.gz
```


2. rm - used to remove files, not folders:
```javascript
$ rm file.txt
```


3. chmod: used to make change file permissions on files (read, write, access):
```javascript
$ chmod 755 shell.sh
```
