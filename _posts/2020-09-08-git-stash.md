Hey there, I just watned to bring some attention to a *very* useful Git command I have been using: stash. Is there a way to update your current branch that has a conflcit? Yes, there is.


1.
```javascript
$ git stash
```


2.
```javascript
$ git pull
```


3.
```javascript
$ git stash pop
```

That's it! Even though my current branch has a conflict, I am still able to update the branch.
